## Origin

Deep within the heart of the Feywild, a realm of endless enchantment and wonder, there lived a young and captivating fey maiden named Aeliana. Her beauty was renowned throughout the realm, her heart was as kind as it was pure, and her singing voice could rival the sweetest melodies of nature itself. Aeliana was a beloved member of her close-knit community, residing by the sparkling shores of an emerald lake.

One fateful evening, bathed in the silvery light of the Feywild moon, Aeliana ventured alone to the tranquil lakeshore. There, she heard a hauntingly beautiful melody that seemed to beckon her, an irresistible call that tugged at the depths of her soul. Driven by a curiosity she couldn't resist, she followed the ethereal song until she reached its source.

On the shore lay a magnificent seal, its fur shimmering with an otherworldly, iridescent luminescence. Its eyes held the secrets of the ages, and it sang the same beguiling, mournful tune. Aeliana, her heart filled with compassion and fascination, reached out to touch the enigmatic seal.

In that moment, a cruel enchantment, wrought by a covetous archfey, ensnared Aeliana's essence. Her form underwent a transformation, and she became a selkie, her fey beauty concealed beneath a shimmering sealskin. She reveled in the waters, her spirit dancing between exhilaration at her newfound existence and the deep longing for her fey family and homeland, forever out of reach.

Unbeknownst to Aeliana, the seal was no ordinary creature but a creation of the covetous archfey, who desired her talents, her beauty, and her voice as their own. The seal spirit bound her to the waters, preventing her from reclaiming her true fey form. Aeliana became the first of the selkies in the Feywild, forever trapped between two worlds, her gifts coveted by the very archfey who had ensnared her.

As the years passed, Aeliana's once-joyful songs took on a mournful quality, a reflection of her bittersweet existence. She yearned for the warmth of her fellow fey and the enchanted forests of her homeland. The other fey mourned her absence, singing their own melancholic songs by the emerald lake, hoping that one day, her heart might find solace in their midst. When she finally found her way back to her people, her love, and her family, she felt the same yearning in her heart for the ocean. She could never feel at home.

Aeliana's tragic tale became a legend in the Feywild, a poignant reminder of the dangers of desire and the consequences of covetousness. Her haunting songs served as a somber warning to all who dared to explore the enchantments of their mystical realm, where beauty and longing often danced together beneath the silver moonlight.
