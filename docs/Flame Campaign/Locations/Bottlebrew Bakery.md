Bottlebrew Bakery in [[Glowstone Market]] is owned and run by Sweets Bottlebrew, a halfling baker married to Barney Duff and son-in-law of Goody Abby from [[Odd Jobs]].

He may be offended if you think the name similarity means he uses Betterbrew in his baked goods. Sweets is an alemane loyalist and his bakery has some merch to advertise it.

He uses his successful bakery to wash some amounts of money acquired through any less legitimate work completed by Odd Jobs.
