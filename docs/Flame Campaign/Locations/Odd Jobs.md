"Odd Jobs" is what everyone calls a for-hire organization called Auld Hobbes in [[Glowstone Market]].

The original owner ran it as a wanna-be adventurers' guild, but took a job with a big downpayment and then didn't deliver (they took a downpayment to buy equipment for a protection job on a big mining shipment, and failed, then failed to return the downpayment). The organization is now deep in debt to a local businessperson, who is a reasonably moral person, but expects payments on a regular schedule to dire consequences without it.

The owner got out of dodge by selling it to Barney Duff, half elf and "personal finance guru" who wanted to buy a low effort business and rake in that sweet passive income. Barney would have failed, and likely be held in conscious stasis as his life energy was leeched off to power machinery in some magical trinket factory as a way to pay the debt, except his mother, Goodwife Absinthe Duff (Goody, or Goody Abby), stepped in.

Abby is a sweet, apparently elderly, always-smells-of-cinnamon-rolls, hair-in-a-big-poofy-bun, Mark of Shadow Eladrin who was born in the feywild but preferred the speed and insanity of the prime material. She got some minor renown as a thief once upon a time under a pseudonym, but now hides her crossbow in her hand basket and looks as innocent as your favorite elderly aunt. She really plays up the white hair and quilting until she wants to go undercover.

She takes any job to keep the place afloat that won't unreasonably piss off another faction. She doesn't do faction vs. faction work, and everyone knows it, and have come to an understanding about it. She also doesn't general work the jobs herself, for that she collects adventurers and other mercenaries from around the city who want a little gold.

Illegal funds get washed through her son-in-law's bakery -- halfling baker Sweets Bottlebrew of [[Bottlebrew Bakery]], far more competent (and a better cook) than his husband/her son.

People that want to pick up regular work for the organization first pick up things off their current log of open work, where locals have consigned small jobs to the organization that don't come with major price tags or risk. Do a few of those and you might get put on retainer. Goody will give those on retainer a small pin that says "Good Odds!" with stars around it which functions as a sending stone only to her/the organization.

**Odd Jobs retainers**

With an Odd Jobs retainer you can get decent but unimpressive food and a bed in a bunk room when you need it. You can also get free tips, directions, introductions, and first dibs on interesting jobs. You're only guaranteed it for 30 days after completing your last job for them, and Goody may cut you off if you turn down a job after that without a good reason.

**Odd Jobs' jobs**

Odd Jobs takes a 30% cut of most work and 20% if it's a specialty assignment that couldn't easily be done by another typical set of adventurers.
