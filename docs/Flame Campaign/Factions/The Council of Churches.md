## Roleplaying Characteristics

### Personality Traits
- We speak the prayers and quote the writings of many saints and gods. We enthusiastically share our faith with everyone.
- We are fascinated by the events of the world and see prophecy and omen in everything
- We see hope for the downtrodden and absolution for the lost. We offer deliverance and mercy for any who seek any truth or light. We condemn those who a without belief.

### Ideals
- Now is the time of the great recreation of the pantheon. The destruction of the dams have brought new and old gods back to Tyriel. Through our devotion, we will ensure the success of our deities.
- Every soul is worthy of redemption. That redemption can come from the deepest depths of ones soul or ones wallet.
- Material possesions and monetary wealth should hold no value in this time of divine greatness. All that matters is your faith and dedication.

### Bonds
- Flame stands as a symbol of the resurrection of the old gods and the birth of the new. We must respect vesperium as the gateway through which the divine has chosen to reenter the world.
- The ruins of old Flame should be protected as holy sites to the old gods.
- The only masters we should bow to are the gods to whom we pray.

### Flaws
- We fight among ourselves about worship of the deities
- Our religions are irrefuteably true
- The prophecies of Bishop Telia Fusili are irrefuteably true. These speak of a great divine battle as there was in the first age. To deny her is to deny truth. 
-  Your god is a threat to mine and if they are not registered with the council it is my job to convert you or strike you down.
