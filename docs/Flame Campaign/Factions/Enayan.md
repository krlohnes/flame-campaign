- Get in our way, and we will cut you down

### Ideals
-  We believe that the people of Flame should control it and its resources. We must all do our duty to restore power to the people. You must be willing to give your life for this.
- We are a small force. Well planned, well executed attacks are worth their weight in gold.
- We are a city of law and order. This should never change

- We trust our comrades-in-arms with our lives and are deeply loyal to one another. We staunchly believe that together we can accomplish what none of us could do alone.

- We all knew the risks when we signed up and must be prepared to sacrifice the lives of our brothers in arms.
- The old ways are paramount. These new gods popping up are a bane on the existance of Flame.
