Protectors of the city. They are part of the Royal Cremelian Marines, but specifically have extra power granted to them to enforce the laws of Flame at a local level. This is somewhat unusual, usually the guard is comprised of locals and not part of the the royal military, though they have been trying to recruit from locals as the popularity of the Fisgrunli monarchy wanes. <br /> <br />

Leader - [[Captain Stevran Helsisle]]
Lieutenant - [[Lieutenant Ghriselia Hillforge]]
Enforcer - [[Sergeant Aimar Altieri]]

Ghriselia Hillforge
As you approach the Dwarven woman, you can't help but notice the fiery red hair that is braided into her thick, luscious beard. She stands about four feet tall, with a sturdy build and broad shoulders that suggest her strength and resilience.

Her skin is tanned from long hours spent working under the sun, and her piercing blue eyes shine with a fierce determination. Her face is adorned with intricate tribal tattoos that curve around her eyes and down her cheeks, adding to her imposing presence.

She wears a set of armor crafted from the finest metals and adorned with gems and intricate engravings. A large, heavy hammer rests at her side, and a small, jeweled dagger is tucked into her belt.
