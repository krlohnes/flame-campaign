Zanybar Innurin - Zanybar Innurin is a brilliant gnome tinkerer with an insatiable curiosity and an endless supply of clever ideas. He has a wiry frame and stands at just over three feet tall, with a shock of bright red hair that seems to have a life of its own. His large, pointed ears are always perked up, listening for any interesting sounds or clues that he can use to improve his latest invention.

Zanybar's workshop is a cluttered and chaotic place, filled with gears, cogs, and scraps of metal. He is always tinkering with some new gadget or device, trying to make it more efficient or effective. He has a particular fascination with clockwork mechanisms and steam-powered engines, and has created some truly remarkable inventions in these areas.

Despite his brilliant mind, Zanybar can be a bit absent-minded at times, often losing track of time or forgetting important details. He has a tendency to become so focused on his work that he forgets to eat or sleep, which can sometimes lead to some comical mishaps.

Zanybar is always eager to share his latest inventions with others, and loves nothing more than seeing his creations put to use in the world. He is a bit of a showman at heart, and will often put on elaborate demonstrations to showcase his latest inventions.

Despite his quirky personality, Zanybar is a loyal friend and will go to great lengths to help those he cares about. He has a particular soft spot for other gnomes, and will often take them under his wing and teach them the art of tinkering.

Overall, Zanybar Innurin is a brilliant and eccentric gnome tinkerer with a passion for creating innovative and useful inventions. He may be a bit absent-minded and quirk



## Roleplaying Characteristics

### Personality Traits
-  We put arcane theory into magical practice. Innovation, creativity, and invention must have purpose.
- We're happy to explain the arcane to anyone. It may take years to master, but only moments to spark curiosity.
- Inquisitiveness is valued. Hard work is necessary.

### Ideals
- Magic should be for the good of all. Selfish magic is evil magic.
- Magic shouldn't be esoteric. It should fulfill a purpose. Even the most mundane magics can make a difference.
- Magic should not be a crutch for poor engineering. 
- We are stronger for our members having the ear of our leadership

### Bonds
- We sell our magic and engineering services to support the guild and teach those to craft magic devices
- We're wary of mages who hole themselves up and guard arcane knowledge.
- We seek to bring the most powerful magic to bear for all of us. Powerful magic can be used for evil if we do not study ways to combat it and have those means in the open. Artifacts should be created to combat that.

### Flaws
- We will always fight if need be. No one is above any one else. We will craft horrific arcane weapons to further our beliefs. 
- We are skeptical of the gods. Why such creatures should hold so much power is almost confusing. Better to give that power to everyone.
- Magical weapons don't kill people. People kill people.
- Those who rely solely on magic are a bit beneath us. What we can bring to bear without is oft times greater than those who lean solely on the arcane.
