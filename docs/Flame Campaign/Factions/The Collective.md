The Collective is both a district and mining cooperative with a rather large buy in to join. It is, however, run and operated by miners. The land they mine, however, is the perview of the Seaward Academy. This should really be seen as a cooperative and have the type of socialist beliefs that entails.

## Roleplaying Characteristics
<br />
### Personality Traits
- Mining is a tough job, but the stone we mine hardens not just our hands, but our resolve.
- We jump at the opportunity to help those in our trust. We can only persevere when everyone can be trusted to their job.
- We are wary of those who have not proven themselves to us.
<br />
### Ideals
- What we do, we do for the good of all. No one of us can mine Vesperium so no one of us should be above the rest.
<br />
### Bonds
- The mines and the tubes must be respected. They are dangerous places if you aren't careful.
- We love everyone who works in these mines like family. Which means hating some of them as well.
<br />
### Flaws
- We have a hatred for the Seaward Academy's quotas restricting our mining operations. If they should be set, they should be set by those who truly understand the rocks and the mines.
