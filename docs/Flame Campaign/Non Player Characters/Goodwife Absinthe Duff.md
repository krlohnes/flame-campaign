Abby is a sweet, apparently elderly, always-smells-of-cinnamon-rolls, hair-in-a-big-poofy-bun, Mark of Shadow Eladrin who was born in the feywild but preferred the speed and insanity of the prime material. She got some minor renown as a thief once upon a time under a pseudonym, but now hides her crossbow in her hand basket and looks as innocent as your favorite elderly aunt. She really plays up the white hair and quilting until she wants to go undercover.
