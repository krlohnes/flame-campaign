## Artificer and Secretive Pseudo-Hobo

Taffeta doesn't have a home, she has hidey-holes. She's seen when she wants to be and not seen when she's not. She is obsessive about information and finding as much information as possible, both to fuel her inventions and fuel her search for meaning in her small universe.
