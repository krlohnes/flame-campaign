the alphabetical stuff mostly comes from https://5e.tools/items.html

I didn't include basic things like bracers of defense, bracers of archery, gauntlets of x power, x of protection, etc.


should have some kind of magical item contact in the city that makes it easier to offload items that are now too low level for the party that require attunement.

teleporter ring is an interesting plot option.

I like the idea of a shield of expression, but it's a helm of expression and it just has a second face on the back of your head.

the azorius (and other) guild signets and keyrunes are good examples of something we could do. Same, badge of the watch

someone uses the rod of security to only exist in the real world for ten days every 210 days

can reskin things as steampunk. mechanical wings of flying?

There are a couple of neat legendary items that could make memorable high level enemies, like blackrazor.

Moonblade could also be an interesting npc item.

A candle of invocation could make an interesting temple fight

Chest of preserving could be interesting in a quest

Cleansing stone at the entrance to somewhere fancy

Conch of teleportation used by enemies

dancing monkey fruit in use at a party

container holding a devastation orb

Living armor would be a great curse quest

mirror of life trapping, but there is something truly awful in there along with the party's friend

Was rolling up random loot one day and ended up with a Cursed Greater Ring of Jumping. So I made it so you couldn't remove it, had a +20 to Jump checks, but you couldn't walk/run anymore, only jump.


Goody should have a needle of mending.



One of my characters asked if any of the Mephits wanted to travel with them. The "runt" of the group jumped out of the fire and said "Me be light!" So, my characters put him in a lantern shell and now have a "Fire Mephit Lantern." It casts light out to 100 feet Cannot be extinguised Speaks Ignan (none of my characters speak Ignan) Talks to the party (Comedic relief, they need it in this campaign) Once a day can use the Mephits "Ray of Scorch"
