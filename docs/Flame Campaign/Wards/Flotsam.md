[[Flotsam]] is the trade hub of the city of Flame.

[[The Vespers]] have a stake in the Flotsam.  They have some enforcers who collect the, of course inflated, port fees. It's a bit lawless, but you better not withhold the port fees. If you want a barge shop, you're paying protection to someone. Other than that, they're happy to look away. For money or favors if you can prove yourself useful. Technically they're under the guard of the city watch and the district councilor, but they too are paid off. There are large portals that can be used to get ships to [[The Cardinal Canals]], but they are prohibitively expensive for all but the largest ships. Most traffic goes through by the foot portals, which they keep a looser leash on, although there is always a close eye on the actual people and very interesting crates might be pushed out of line. The portals are maintained by [[The Seaward Academy]].


Flotsam is a fraction of the diameter of Flame hanging above, and rests roughly center below it. Most of the time that means they get fine light, but in the midday a shade passes over it. The edges stay bright with the indirect light around the city, but the centers of Flotsam get shadier and the bustle slows. Locals think of the shade as the chill and nap time of the day, but some locals who don't enjoy bright light become a little more active. At all times, water pours from the Skyward Canals off the side of the city to thunder into the sea around Flotsam. As the wind shifts, spray and mist may be spread across Flotsam but it's far from being hit. During dawn and dusk sometimes the sun shines straight through one of the falls and makes the seedy structures glow gold and pink.

Few buildings are actually buildings, most are boats permanently lashed up to the floating platforms.

Around Flotsam is a network of lane markers as traffic moves around several floating farms (kelp, shellfish, etc.) and marked-off fishing areas that change over time.

Flotsam itself contains:

[[Flotsam Locks]], the actual set of 4 portals that pass full size ships up to the Skyward Canals above. They are generally quite large to accommodate large import and export shipments organized by the city government or major organizations. Every once in a while if a much bigger ship needs to enter, a portal can be temporarily expanded, but it strains it and can't be reopened that wide for a while.

[[Flotsam Doors]], or "the doors" are the pedestrian portals.  Foot traffic, both individuals and small vehicles, passes through 6 open portals, which people and foot and vehicles shunted into different lanes. You must pass through customs to declare imports and exports. You may not import animals into Flame without a permit unless you can prove it is a familiar or other similar being that does not require food or create excrement. Any vehicles that enter are being pulled by hand, magic, or some mechanical means.
