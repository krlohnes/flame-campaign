# Flame
A floating city in the sky above the [[Gulf of Cremelia]]

## Narrative Description

Flame is both an old city and a new city.

Flame once hovered above the ocean, covering a mysterious stone called [[Flame Campaign/Vesperium|vesperium]] and converged on by invisible lines of magical power. When the lines of power were dammed thousands of years ago by those who wanted to bar monsters from entering the Prime Material, Flame fell to the ocean floor and out of living memory. It lay in its grave until a few centuries ago, when a small group of adventurers broke down the dams and restored the flow of magic, upon which Flame rose like a magnet back into the air and into life.

Flame was in ruins when the first new settlers came. Flame lies in the gulf of a continent spanning kingdom known as [[Cremelia]], which, although it had recently survived both civil and interplanar war, wanted to establish its claim as soon as it could. Scholars and archaeologists explored the crumbling city, where marks of religions, rituals, economies, and power that had left the world were everywhere and on everything.

They were followed quickly by the mining companies. And the tax collectors. And organized crime.

But Cremelia's claim on Flame was questioned by other countries, who didn't want to miss their chance to gain from [[Flame Campaign/Vesperium|vesperium]], nor to give up the potential and unknown powers it might have.  Flame became the most diverse city in all of Cremelia... for now.

Flame is loud, Flame is quiet, Flame is rich (very rich, due to the sale of [[Flame Campaign/Vesperium|vesperium]]), Flame is poor (for the unlucky ones who come out on the bottom). The world is more magical than it had been for millenia as dams were broken and lost history returned. Flame may be more magical than them all. The world recently faced an incursion of Destruction, a forgotten, bound force that was freed by hell and the shadowfell, destroyed millions, and changed entire planes of existence. Creation, Order, and Chaos all rose to have a hand in binding it again, and now people are aware of, and studying, and sometimes worshipping, these four fundamental forces as the world tries to balance itself.

Everyone wants a piece of the pie. Corporations. Politicians. Idealists. Anti-monarchists. Loyalists. Foreign agents. Old gods. New gods. Beings who want to be gods. People who want to change the world. People that just want to be left alone. The building is both ancient and stately and shiny and new, as restorationists and developers fight over the ongoing reconstruction.

In a physically isolated and highly magical city, some of the standards of sword and sorcery have changed. Airships sail in and out of Flame airspace. Rather than horses and other pack animals, you will see pedal vehicles of all types and conjured creatures pulling very heavy loads or very rich beings. You won't be trekking across wide distances through the jungle, but navigating alleys and riding public transportation and using various tunnels or airways to get from one ward to another.

Your character has a reason to get into Flame. They have a reason to not want to work alone all the time. They have long term goals and dreams.

It's a new age in the world of Tyriel.

## The Government of Flame
The government of Flame is a contentious point at the point we come in, so there will be faction tension here. It is technically under the rule of [[Cremelia]]. After the Fall of the Triarchy during the Rise of Destruction, power was consolidated into a single monarch under Fisgrunli Wraithsbane, though some was distributed to a council/cabinet that technically has power to unseat the monarch if they think they are compromised or otherwise unfit. This consolidation of power has been unpopular and some in Flame want independence. Others believe they contribute more than they should to the taxes of the land and hold much of the GDP in their hands so they should be independent since the sale of [[Flame Campaign/Vesperium]] is so profitable. There's, of course, others who view this differently.

Each of the districts of Flame have an elected councilor and an elected mayor sits at the head of government. [[New Topic]]


## Immigration to Flame
We're in the middle of a [[Flame Campaign/Vesperium|vesperium]] rush, though mining rights have mostly been consolidated into 3 general mining companies, the [[Mining Cooperatives]], there are still fortunes to be made by leasing a stake and exploring for [[Flame Campaign/Vesperium|vesperium]]. This has brought a lot of people to Flame.

## Relationship to foreign powers
This is an interesting question I haven't given _too_ much thought, but I was thinking sort of a Hong Kong situation. This is definitely something to flesh out. Open to suggestions here


## Defenses for Flame
Defenses against air is interesting. Airships must be part of travel to Flame. You can see enemy ships incoming from a ways off... but there is still risk of magic covering them. Maybe they have outlook stations around the sea, like coast guard radio outposts. When an outpost goes radio silent, it causes a major reaction.  [[The Cardinal Canals]] portals can be shut down in the event of a lockdown for a storm surge or attacks.

## Smuggling
Mostly through the air

## Potable Water
Reverse osmosis and desalination through [[Flame Campaign/Vesperium]]

## Transportation
lots of velocipedes/bicycles/pedal cars, with the very rich using elementals to pull them
