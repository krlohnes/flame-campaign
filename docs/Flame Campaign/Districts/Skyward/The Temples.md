A temple district skyward

The temple buildings are of a generally formal, serious design that matches the look these kinds of sacred buildings have in the rest of Cremelia. ... expect right now they are covered in as many signs, banners, holiday decor, or other exciting, interesting material as can be found. Banner announce the amazing deeds of one god vs. another, music plays from the doors of a shrine where you can smell free food available inside, the few serious buildings have worshippers outside trying to flag down passerby to hear a speech about the One True Religion, while some worshippers who don't rank a formal building are standing on boxes on the corners shouting at the people around them and holding up signs promising death if you don't meet at twilight in a nearby park to hear the Word of Somebody.

Think Las Vegas, but the big casinos are trying to bring you into their religion.
