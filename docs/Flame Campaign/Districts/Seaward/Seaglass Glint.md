This is the equivalent of a gated community for the ultra rich, with a series of adjacent compounds with park-like surroundings of shade plants. It's on trend to grow poisonous and dangerous plants in Poison Gardens on your property, and a couple keep magical sun lights that have real day-night cycles in a localized area to grow more than just shade poisons. The residents have fantastically shaped homes with loops and viewing areas that maximize the amount of clear glass-like ceilings that face down to the sea. (Perhaps one eccentric has a room that excludes the flipped gravity magic where you walk and dine and chat and dance with nothing visible between you and the distant waves.) This is how the district got its name . Being on the southeast side of the island it has a tendency to glint into the eyes of sailors at sunrise. Of course, it's not centered directly above the rough and tumble [[Flotsam]], just somewhere where [[Flotsam]] is visible as part of a larger landscape of plants and waves and ships and the clouds floating between you and them. I hope you're not afraid of heights.



Characters who suffer from motion sickness may make constitution saving throws from the mindscrew of having down be visibly above you, making the gravity madness ever present and stomach turning. You can lay down on your back to stare up, which is also down, and feel more stable, but then I really hope you're not afraid of heights.
