The Gloaming is one of the [[Seaward Districts]] where a large number of tinkerers, alchemists, and other people who enjoy or work with stone live. It has a higher than normal population of dwarves, gnomes, and to a lesser extent drow. The buildings are cut in a faceted way and faced with reflective stone so that the limited sun it gets in the early and late parts of the day makes the whole district glow. At other times the glow is dimmer as artificial lights create smaller glints and gleams at ground level, where otherwise the main source of brightness is the sea far, far below.
